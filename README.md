Welcome to my Github 
SawGamer

What you will find here is small projects or learning materials for both Java 8 and Python 3

Java files are from private class i took earlier this year.
the python files are from the coursera course "Python for everybody" by the amzing Charles Severance , after ending the specialisation i wanted to upload  the files here just for personal refrence but feel free to use any of the files or codes above under the Apache2 licence 


Happy coding !!!
